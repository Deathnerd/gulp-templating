# gulp-templating
A quick and dirty gulp templating solution complete with examples. Uses Swig and Gulp-Usemin to process templates


### Install
Simply run `npm install` in the root directory and `bower install` in the src directory

### Usage
Run the default task (`gulp`) to start a Browser-Sync session that watches the `./dist` folder for and triggers the build task when source files are changed. Also reloads the browser when the build is done.
Run the build task (`gulp build`) to manually run the build. Enjoy!
